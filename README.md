# Enterprise Cybersecurity Lab Infrastructure


### Project Overview

Enterprise Cybersecurity Lab is a hands-on project that simulates a real-world enterprise network environment to test, analyze, and improve cybersecurity defenses through penetration testing and security monitoring.

This project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and secure complex network infrastructures while simulating real-world cyber attacks.

### Key Features

- **Network Topology:** Designed and implemented a NAT-based network with VirtualBox, including DHCP and DNS services.

- **Active Directory:** Deployed and managed Microsoft Active Directory for user and resource management.

- **Email Server:** Configured and secured an SMTP relay server using **Postfix** on Ubuntu Server.

- **Security Monitoring:** Integrated **Wazuh** and **Security Onion** for intrusion detection and log analysis.

- **Penetration Testing:** Conducted simulated attacks using tools like **Hydra**, **Evil-WinRM**, and **NetExec**.

- **Documentation:** Created detailed, step-by-step guides for each phase of the project, from setup to attack simulation.
